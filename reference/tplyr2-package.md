# tplyr2: A Grammar of Clinical Summary Tables

Implements a grammar of summary data for clinical reports. Clinical
summary tables are decomposed into modular layers, each representing an
independent summary block. Supports count, descriptive statistics, and
shift layer types with a declarative spec-based API built on data.table
for performance.
